Machine Learning Credit scoring and Fraud Detection  

## Credit scoring
### Project Intro/Objective
The purpose of this project is helping the troubled lenders with this problem by creating a model that can help them make their decision. 

### Project Description
For most financial institutions, such as banks and multi-finance companies, their main source of income is coming from their lending activities. By engaging in this activity, it means that lenders are exposed to the potential risk, where debtors stop repaying their loans, causing losses to the lenders. To mitigate this loss, lenders are expected to appropriately choose who are qualified for a loan, at what rate, and at what amount.
In this project, we are tasked to help the troubled lenders with this problem by creating a model that can help them make their decision. 

### Methods Used
* Dataset Preprocessing (SQL)
* Simple Exploratory Data Analysis
* Feature Selection using Random Forrest and SelectKBest (f_classif)
* Predictive Modeling
* Evaluation Metrix

### Important Concepts
Credit card and home loans are two very good examples of credit given to a borrower by a lender. Money in a credit card is not ours, We need to pay it back. If we fail to pay it, we need to repay with interest. Home loans are another type of credit given. For this, we have a collateral i.e, this could be used to recover money if the customers fails to pay back. Asset financing is another good example of credit. Organizations don't buy the assets at one go instead they finance it and pay it over the time.  

### Conclusion
1. Neural Network with Oversampling Technique Algorithm (SMOTE) has better accuracy (92%) for the train dataset than Logistic Regression, Random Forrest and Decision Tree in both after tuned or before tuned. However, Evaluation Metrics show that Random Forrest algorithm has better accuracy, which is 80.24% in Test Dataset than Neural Network.
