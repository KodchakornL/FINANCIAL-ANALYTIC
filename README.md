Machine Learning Credit scoring and Fraud Detection  

## Credit scoring
### Project Intro/Objective
The purpose of this project is helping the troubled lenders with this problem by creating a model that can help them make their decision. 

### Project Description
For most financial institutions, such as banks and multi-finance companies, their main source of income is coming from their lending activities. By engaging in this activity, it means that lenders are exposed to the potential risk, where debtors stop repaying their loans, causing losses to the lenders. To mitigate this loss, lenders are expected to appropriately choose who are qualified for a loan, at what rate, and at what amount.
In this project, we are tasked to help the troubled lenders with this problem by creating a model that can help them make their decision. 

### Methods Used
* Dataset Preprocessing (SQL)
* Simple Exploratory Data Analysis
* Feature Selection using Random Forrest and SelectKBest (f_classif)
* Predictive Modeling
* Evaluation Metrix
